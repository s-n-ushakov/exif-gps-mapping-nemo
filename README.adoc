[.lead]
A Cinnamon Nemo custom action and related scripts for displaying Exif metadata of media files in Nemo and for plotting
GPS position thereof using various online mapping services

## Background

### Exif, Cinnamon Nemo

https://www.cipa.jp/std/documents/download_e.html?DC-008-Translation-2023-E[Exif] is a standard, specified{nbsp}/ issued
by JEIDA{nbsp}/ https://www.jeita.or.jp/english/[JEITA]{nbsp}/ https://www.cipa.jp/e/index.html[CIPA], that specifies
formats for media files, as well as ancillary metadata tags, to be used by digital cameras{nbsp}/ scanners and sound
recorders. MPEG video formats also allow containing metadata in media files. This metadata, besides various camera and
shooting mode information, such as the camera model and make, aperture, shutter speed, focal length, ISO speed, etc.,
may also contain geolocation information.

https://github.com/linuxmint/nemo[Nemo] is the file manager for the https://github.com/linuxmint/cinnamon[Cinnamon]
desktop environment, the primary one for https://linuxmint.com/[Linux Mint].

### The problem

Nemo out-of-the box facilities for displaying media file metadata are limited and allow no access to geolocation info.

Command-line utilities exist like https://github.com/libexif/exif[`exif`] and https://exiftool.org/[`exiftool`] that
allow displaying various media file metadata in a terminal session, GPS position included, but no integration with Nemo
is immediately available, and no integration with online mapping services is available either.

## The solution

Nemo has a provision for being extended with custom actions and is distributed with a custom action example as
https://github.com/linuxmint/nemo/blob/master/files/usr/share/nemo/actions/sample.nemo_action[`sample.nemo_action`].

With mentioned `sample.nemo_action` as a prototype, a custom Nemo action and related scripts were developed that allow
displaying an additional context menu for `image/jpeg` and `video/mp4` media types with further:

- displaying Nemo{nbsp}/ https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/zenity[Zenity] dialog boxes with Exif metadata being displayed
in their native tabular format available from `exif` and `exiftool` utilities;
- displaying shooting point locations using various online mapping services like OpenStreetMap, Google Maps, Bing
Maps, etc. in a browser of choice.

### The solution structure

A release archive contains the following files:

```
├─ nemo/
│  └─ actions/
│     ├─ exif_metadata__functions.bash            : local reusable functions library

│     ├─ exif_metadata_menu.bash                  : script to display a menu of available actions
│     └─ exif_metadata_menu.nemo_action           : the Nemo action descriptor

├─ diff-with-current-user.bash                    : script to compare contents of the
│                                                 :   'nemo/actions' folder with the one in the
│                                                 :   current user profile
├─ COPYING                                        : GPL license text
├─ NOTICE                                         : GPL notice text
└─ README.adoc                                    : user manual (this document)
```

### Usage

- download a release archive and unpack to an arbitrary temporary folder;
- open the folder that was created upon unpacking the release archive;
- run the installation script as `./install-for-current-user.bash`.

With all that successfully in place, a new context menu should become available in Nemo for files that have `image/jpeg`
or `video/mp4` media types. Menu item title is subject to internationalization, with English title being "Display Exif
metadata menu". With this menu item having been selected, a popup menu is displayed with a list of actions available
depending on the context. Possible actions may include:

- Display Exif metadata using 'exiftool' utility;
- Display Exif metadata using 'exif' utility;
- Display GPS position in various online mapping services.

The list of online mapping services is extensible, as it is derived automatically from the collection of
`exif_metadata_mapping_*.bash` scripts found in the `${HOME}/.local/share/nemo/actions` folder.

### Prerequisites

The solution requires at least one of the following utilities to be available:

// a table with:
// - automatic column width,
// - 2 columns
[%autowidth,cols=2]
|===
|'exif'
|a simple Exif data handling utility, limited to `image/jpeg` only

|'exiftool'
|a well-recognized Exif data handling utility, with extended metadata tag set and with support for variety of media file
formats
|===

### Possible customizations

#### Internationalization

The solution currently has the following provisions for internationalization:

* `LANGUAGE` variable defined in `exif_metadata__settings.bash`:
** overrides{nbsp}/ shadows similar user profile variable;
** defaults to shortened language-code-only user profile setting as `"${LANGUAGE/_*/}"`;
** has effect on language settings of the utilities and on online mapping services;
* main menu item name and comment, specified in `exif_metadata_menu.nemo_action`;
* popup menu item names for metadata display actions, specified as `descriptions_metadata_exiftool` and
`descriptions_metadata_exif` variables in `exif_metadata_menu.bash`;
* popup menu item names for GPS position display actions, specified as custom comments in related
`exif_metadata_mapping_*.bash` scripts.

#### Browser for displaying GPS position in online mapping services

Browser can be selected using the `BROWSER` variable defined in `exif_metadata__settings.bash` that defaults to default
system browser wrapper as `xdg-open`.

#### Types of media files handled by the solution

Types of media files handled by the solution are specified using their media types, and their list is currently
restricted to `image/jpeg` and `video/mp4` by the `Mimetypes` setting in the `exif_metadata_menu.nemo_action` file.

Nothing prevents this list from being extended, provided that related media types are supported by metadata handling
utilities.

#### Online mapping services for displaying GPS position

Collection of online mapping services for displaying GPS position may be customized by deleting or adding to the
collection of `exif_metadata_mapping_*.bash` scripts.

Please feel free to add new scripts using existing scripts as samples and contribute :)

#### Alternative{nbsp}/ extra metadata handling utilities

Collection of metadata handling utilities may be extended if necessary. Please consider `exif_metadata_list_exif.bash`
and `exif_metadata_list_exiftool.bash` scripts as samples for new utility wrappers. Popup menu creation script
`exif_metadata_menu.bash` will also need an addition inside.
